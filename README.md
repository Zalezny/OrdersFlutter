# OrdersFlutter

A Flutter project similar to [OrdersKatyaPublic](https://github.com/Zalezny/OrderKatyaPublic) project. Some screens are configured to iOS but it is still in work.

EDIT: iOS not supported yet. Unfortunately you cannot debug this app because is missing firebase and api config (for security).

Use:

- Material Design
- Cupertino Design
- REST API
